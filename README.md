ALL IN 1 HUB
This website is created by 4 members by the group name of Almight Coders. We creted this app because the user can easily use the apps for so many purposes! App:- Many people use To do list to schedule their time and to reduce peaper work that peaper they use maybe canot help them another time! So this app is gona help users to their to do list app all the time! QUIZ APP:- to help teenager who are just like us to prepare them for Entrance exam and is all about using a given time to finish a task and tha will help them to be read for the exam. Weather APP:- is a web application which tells a user what the weather condition and thet temprature in a given city.

We use a simple HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to develop and make it suitable for the user coustemer and so on. We learned a lot as a team and to make connnections with other and work as a team so tis was a great experience for all of working and

This is was not possible if there is no a guide from ALX mentors whom helped us to know an essential topis an treat us very kindly.
